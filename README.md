# Portfolio
This github repo has been made to present my codestyle, skills and knowledge.

**Note that programms, in general, use file streams, not standard I/O.** Please, read commented header or "body" to find out, how you should name your input files and fill it correctly.

Also, there are some input/output samles at ./languageName/**input/** and ./languageName/**output/** directories.
### Contents
"cpp" directory contains C++ code samples. To be precise:
1. Set. *Realisation of set() class using hashtable. Asymtotics is close to O(1), worst case is O(N)*
2. Linked Map *LinkedMap() class realised using hashtable. General asymptotics is O(1), remove() function works for O(N)*

"python" directory stores Python code such as:
1. Text editor. *Finds mistakes in text, comparing words to dictionary. Calculates Levinstein distances and corrects mistakes with distance <= 2.*
2. // Not yet // Matrix calculator. *Supports basic operations, such as multiplying matrix by number, matrix by matrix, addition, subtraction, etc.*
