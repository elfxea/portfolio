## Python code samples
Generally, this folder contains my labs at "Introduction to Digital Culture and Programming" and "Linear algebra" for first course.
### Config
Python version: 3.8.5
### File structure
If there is no opportunity to test my code, you can see at least one sample:

**./input/** directory contains input files for *.py files in this folder (file names are specified at commented header in each program).

**./output/** directory contains output files for *.py files in this forder.
