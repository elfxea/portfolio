## CPP code samples
Generally, this folder contains my favourite labs at Algorythms and Data Structures for first course.
### Setup
Running on Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS)
GCC version: 4:9.3.0-1ubuntu2
CMake version: 3.16.3-1ubuntu1
### File structure
If there is no opportunity to test my code, you can see at least one sample:
**./input/** directory contains input files for *.cpp files in this folder (names are the same as *.cpp files named).
**./output/** directory contains output files for *.cpp files in this forder.
